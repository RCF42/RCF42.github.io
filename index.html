											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p> Hi!, I'm Robert Frazier, a first year grad student in the University of Michigan's Astronomy Department.
											I work with Emily Rauscher and I am currently working on calculating simulated JWST spectral phase curves of the 
											ultrahot Jupiter WASP-121b to compare to observations. Through these spectroscopic phase curves it's possible to probe 
											the extreme dynamics of ultrahot Jupiters.
											This work is done using the group's 3D climate model, RM-GCM. 

											


											
											
											<p> In my free time I enjoy baking, hiking, and going down rabbit holes on wikipedia.  

											<p>	You can reach me at robertcf@umich.edu! And this is my <a href="/images/RCF Grad School CV.docx (2).pdf"> CV</a>

										<h3> Hot Jupiter Dynamics </h3>
										<p> Currently, I work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/emily-rauscher/home?authuser=0"> Emily Rauscher </a> using 3D climate models of hot Jupiters to better understand their dynamics 
											and generate observables from these models to compare to observations. This lets us probe the extreme dynamics these worlds have, such as superrotational winds and large scale magnetic drag.</p>

										<h3> The Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect</h3>
										<p> At my undergrad, Penn State, I worked with <a href="https://science.psu.edu/astro/people/sqm107"> Suvrath Mahadevan </a> and <a href = "https://gummiks.github.io/"> Guðmundur Stefánsson </a> where we used high precision radial velocity measurements from NEID to
											determine the obliquities of the young sub-Neptune WASP-121b using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.</p>

										<h3>Planetary Dynamics and Evolution </h3>
										<p>Overall, I have a keen interest in everything that relates to planetary dynamics and evolution. I hope to work towards observations and models
										that help inform and constrain models for how planets form, evolve, and mechanically work.</p>

									<h2>Outreach and DEI</h2>
									<p>I am committed to creating a welcoming and diverse environment
									wherever I am.</p>

								<p>While at Penn State I was the president of its <a href ="https://sites.psu.edu/psusps/"> Society of Physics Students (SPS) chapter </a> I worked tirelessly 
								to try and make it an open and welcoming environment to everyone. I also committed to working towards diversity, equity, and inclusion
								in the physics department at Penn State. I assisted with and served as webmaster for <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/cuwip2023/"> the 2023 Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) being held
								at Penn State </a> and I was a part of the local <a href = "https://www.aps.org/programs/innovation/fund/idea.cfm"> APS IDEA team </a> where we worked to increase diversity in the department. One of my continuous goals has 
								been to try and make the undergraduates feel like they are a part of the department, and not people passing through. To this end I 
								worked on increased information shared with us undergrads and on more events and activities where professors, graduates, and undergrads can
								interact in a non-academic environment.

								<p> Now at the University of Michigan I again am striving towards helping ensure an inclusive and open environment for its members across all levels. 
									I am currently involved in a mentoring program between the grad students in the Astronomy Department and its undergrads through the Student Astronomical Society, 
									and I serve as the Undergrad Liason between the grad students and undergrads. </p>
