											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hey! Hi!, I'm Robert Frazier, a 4th year undergrad at Penn State majoring in Physics and Astronomy.
											I am currently doing exoplanet research with Professor Mahadevan and Guðmundur Stefánsson with the NEID instrument. 
											I'm also the president of Penn State's Society of Physics Student chapter.
											
											<p> In my free time I like baking, hiking, and reading too many random wikipedia articles. 

											<p>	You can reach me at rcf5201@psu.edu!

										<h3> The Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect</h3>
										<p> Currently, I work with Suvrath Mahadevan and Guðmundur Stefánsson where we use high precision radial velocity measurements from NEID to
											determine the obliquities of planetary systems with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.</p>

										<h3>Protoplanetary Disks</h3>
										<p>Previously (and as my first researc experience), I worked with Ian Czekala on his MPoL software package to use regularized maximal likelihood imaging to reconstruct radio
											interferometry data of protoplanetary disks.</p>

										<h3>Planetary Formation and Evolution</h3>
										<p>Overall, I have a keen interest in everything that relates to planetary formation and evolution. I hope to work towards observations and models
										that help inform and constrain formation and evolution theories as well as on the theories themselves.</p>

									<h2>Outreach and Activities</h2>
									<p>I am committed to creating a welcoming and diverse environment
									wherever I am.</p>
									<span class="image"><img src="images/sps (3).jpg" alt=""></span>
								</header>
								<p>I am the president of Penn State's local Society of Physics Students (SPS) chapter, and I have worked tirelessly 
								to try and make it an open and welcoming environment to everyone. I have also committed to working towards diversity, equity, and inclusion
								in the physics department at Penn State. I am currently helping out with the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) being held
								at Penn State and I am part of the local APS IDEA team where we work to increase diversity in the department. One of my continuous goals has 
								been to try and make the undergraduates feel like they are a part of the department, and not people passing through. To this end I have 
								worked on increased information shared with us undergrads and on more events and activities where professors, graduates, and undergrads can
								interact in a non-academic environment.</p>
